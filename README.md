- I have no idea what works, I made this and at the time all the things worked and had existed on his site since it had opened. It shouldn't be this easy Jay....

## Exploits

- Warning: Pretty much everything here is "patched" due to jay and his "dev" making rate limits to everything (including CSS ????) they're also logging IP's of people who send more than 2 requests to their site so you will most likely get your IP logged in plain text if you use this, or if you just visit their site in general. Oh also view botting still works, they fixed everything BUT view botting... seems to me like they want their site to look active.
